# About Me

-  Master's Degree student in Quantitative Asset and Risk Management (ARIMA) at the UEK in Katowice and FH des BFI Vien.  
-  Interested in quantitative finance, algorythmic trading, stochastic modeling and risk modeling.  
-  I'm building tools to analyze investment profitability, predict asset prices, and manage financial risk – using Python and R.

## What do i use

- Mostly `Python`, `R` and `Excel`

## Current Projects

- **Portfolio Risk & Optimization System**  
 A Python-based tool for real-time analysis of portfolios using Stooq and YFinance.
 Estimating risk (**VaR**, **Expected Shortfall**), and calculating key statistics such as **CAGR**, **Expected Return**, and descriptive metrics.  

- **Monte Carlo Simulation Engine for Portfolio Forecasting**  
  Incorporates historical return distributions, stochastic modeling, and scenario generation to estimate risk measures like **VaR** and **Expected Shortfall**.  
  Outputs include visualizations, confidence intervals, and Excel exports for practical integration with investment dashboards.

- **Distribution Fitting & Tail Risk Analysis in R**  
  R-based module for **statistical distribution fitting** and **goodness-of-fit testing** on financial returns.  
  Supports parametric modeling (e.g., Normal, Student-t, Rweibull, Lognormal, Gamma) and diagnostic tools to select best-fit models, with applications in tail risk estimation and 
  stress testing.
